# Overlap with Methylation

The methylation peaks will be read in from the right files. 

```{r use_dir}
data_dir <- "/mlab/data/rmflight/Documents/projects/work/fondufe-mittendorf_lab/parp1_data"
library(GenomicRanges)
library(magrittr)
```

```{r read_methylation}
methyl_files <- file.path(data_dir, dir(data_dir, pattern = "CTCF_narrow_peak_H"))
methyl_names <- strsplit(methyl_files, "_") %>% sapply(., function(x){x[6]})
methyl_names <- strtrim(methyl_names, nchar(methyl_names) - 4)

names(methyl_files) <- methyl_names

methyl_data <- lapply(methyl_files, function(x){
  tmp <- read.table(x, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
  GRanges(seqnames = tmp$chrom,
          ranges = IRanges(start = tmp$chromStart, end = tmp$chromEnd),
          mcols = DataFrame(tmp[, c("b1", "b2", "b3")]))
})
```
