# Data Munging

Loading some data to see what we have.

```{r load_chrom_22}
library(GenomicRanges)
tmp <- read.table("../../parp1_data/YFM_LN5_chr22.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
head(tmp)
```

So each entry has a *bead*, a *startx*, and a *strand*. This looks like it has been aligned to the genome given the *startx* field. 

What is curious is that there does not appear to be a *stopx* or *endx* in the file. 

So lets put this into a `GenomicRanges` object to work with it some more, and we will just make the width 1.

```{r chr22_GRanges}
chr22 <- GRanges(seqnames = "chr22", ranges = IRanges(start = tmp$startx, width = 1), strand = tmp$strand)
chr22 <- sort(chr22)
rm(tmp)
chr22
```
